> In a monotonic stack, the elements are pushed onto the stack in a way that the top element of the stack always satisfies a certain order

 >   **WHAT KIND OF ORDER ?** 
	 - Monotonic Increase : increasing or staying the same left to right
	 - Monotonic Decrease : Decreasing or staying the same left to right

>   **HOW IS IT USED?**
	- We use pop() or push() operations to delete and insert elements 
	- Mainly USED to solve problems related to finding next greater or smallest element in an array

>   **COMPLEXITY**
	- Time Complexity - O(n)
	- Space Complexity - O(n)
