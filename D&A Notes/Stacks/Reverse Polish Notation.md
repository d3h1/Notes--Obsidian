- Simply known as postfix notation -- operators follow their operands
- The advantage of reverse Polish notation is that it removes the need for order of operations and parentheses that are required by [infix notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infix_notation "Infix notation") and can be evaluated linearly, left-to-right. For example, the infix expression (3 × 4) + (5 × 6) becomes 3 4 × 5 6 × + in reverse Polish notation.
