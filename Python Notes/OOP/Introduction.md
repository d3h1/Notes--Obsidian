# Introduction
In procedural programing, the program is broken down into smaller parts called methods

#### Methods
> Methods are basic entities used to construct a program

The main advantage behind this is for code reusabilitiy

##### CONS 
Can become a massive and crazy task if it becomes a complex real world solution. 

## OOP
This is where OOP takes place
>Basic entities of OOP are Classes and Objects, the bread and butter

>The idea behind OOP is to solve real world problems that are otherwise too coplex to solve

This is done through splitting up a complex problem into a number of objects that will **communicate** with each other

#### Objects
Objects frequently represent real world objects in programs

> Note: It is also possible for objects to server application logic and have no direct correlation to real world problems

They manage things like:
- authentication
- templating
- request handling
- any of the other myriad features needed for a practical application.
